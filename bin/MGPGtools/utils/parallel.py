class Parallel(object):
    """Processes data in parallel.

    This class implements a producer/consumer model for
    processing data in parallel. In order to keep data
    handling efficient the main process acts as the
    consumer. This keeps all consumed data in the
    address space of the main process.

    Producer and consumer functions are passed to
    the run() method. The return value of the producer
    function is provided to the consumer as an argument.
    The producer function must not return None. If a generic
    return value is required simply return True. A progress
    function can also be specified which allows a progress
    string to be defined.

    Example:

        class Test(object):
            def _producer(self, data):
                return data * data

            def _consumer(self, produced_data, consumer_data):

                    consumer_data = 0

                consumer_data += produced_data
